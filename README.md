# sb-scripts

This repo contains some scripts I use for my dwm status bar. Each one
prints out one line of text with content descriped by the script name.
To use them, put them in your path. I use them with
[dwmblocks](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dwmblocks) but any status
bar that calls scripts that return the text to display should work just
as well.
