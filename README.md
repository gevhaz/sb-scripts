# sb-scripts

This repo contains some scripts I use for my dwm status bar. Each one
prints out one line of text with content descriped by the script name.
To use them, put them in your path. I use them with
[dwmblocks](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dwmblocks) but any status
bar that calls scripts that return the text to display should work just
as well.

Here's a screenshot of what it can look like when used with dwmblocks in
dwm with Nord theme:

# Licence

These scripts are likely too small to be covered by copyright but just
to be sure, I hereby release those of the scripts in this repo that I am
the author of to the public domain. It is clear from the comments in the
code when I'm not the author.
